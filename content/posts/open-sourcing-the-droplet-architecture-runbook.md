title: "Open-sourcing the Droplet architecture runbook"

In my [last blog post](https://blog.ktachibana.party/2022/06/04/my-infrastructure-setup.html) I talked about the infrastructure setup that I am currently using: A crowd of droplets.

For that architecture, I also mentioned that I keep a living documentation for setting up a "standard" droplet with consistent naming and etc, so that future maintenance would be easier.

Today I am open-sourcing this living documentation. My hope is that by open-sourcing it, I'll keep it tidy and easy-to-read for myself, and hopefully I'll translate the documentation into actual automation (Ansible?) in the future.

[Here is the documentation](https://github.com/k-t-corp/apollo/blob/master/RUNBOOK.md)
